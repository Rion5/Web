    <p>.forEach takes a callback function, that callback function is expected to have at least 1, but up to 3, arguments. This is how .forEach was designed.</p>
    <ul>The arguments are in a specific order:
        <li>The first one represents each element in the array (per loop iteration) that .forEach was called on.</li>
        <li>The second represents the index of said element.</li>
        <li>The third represents the array that .forEach was called on (it will be the same for every iteration of the loop).</li>
    </ul>
